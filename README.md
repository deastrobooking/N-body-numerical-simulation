# N-body-numerical-simulation

An script written in Python to integrate the equations of motion of N particles interacting with each other gravitationally.
The script computes the equations of motion and use scipy.integrate to integrate them.
Then it uses matplotlib to visualize the solution.

Example of a simulation:
